  natives Streamer_DestroyAllItems and Streamer_CountItems are
  preferred now, but old natives are still usable)
- Added a new parameter called "serverwide" to the destroy and count
  natives that makes them work either across all scripts or only
  within the calling script

  Is(Any)PlayerIn(Any)DynamicArea which allows an area check to occur
  without issuing a full update for the player
- Added a "dimensions" parameter to Streamer_GetDistanceToItem which
  allows the script to specify whether a 2D or 3D distance check
  should be performed
